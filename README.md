# Modified_Work_Day_Scheduler


### Modified Work Day Scheduler 

Everyone needs to keep track of the things that need to get done through their work day. I was presented with some basic stater code and was ask to add some styling and functionality to the application. In this application, the user is presented with webpage that has the current day and sets of time blocks that are assigned each hour of a typical 9 to 5 job. The user can also input an event or task for any of the time blocks and save it. The time blocks are also color coordinated to indicate to the user if that hour is in the past, present or future of that current day.
